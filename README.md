## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python script (presumably in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab notebook) that performs the following steps:

1.  **Importing Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model training.
2.  **Data Collection and Processing:**
    *   Loads the `gld_price_data.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame.
    *   Explores the dataset (head, tail, shape, info, null values).
    *   Calculates statistical measures of the data.
    *   Analyzes the correlation between the features and the target variable ('GLD'). A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlations. The 'Date' column is dropped as it's not used as a feature in this model.
    *   Visualizes the distribution of the GLD price using a distribution plot.
3.  **Splitting Features and Target:** Separates the features (input variables) from the target variable (GLD price).
4.  **Splitting into Training and Testing Data:** Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model. 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing.
5.  **Model Training:**
    *   Initializes a Random Forest Regressor model with 100 estimators.
    *   Trains the model using the training data.
6.  **Model Evaluation:**
    *   Predicts the GLD price on the test data.
    *   Evaluates the model's performance using the R-squared error metric.
7.  **Comparing Actual and Predicted Values:** Plots the actual GLD prices against the predicted prices for the test set to visually assess the model's accuracy.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
2.  Ensure the `gld_price_data.csv` file is in the same directory as your notebook or provide the correct path.
3.  Run the code cells in your Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab notebook sequentially.

## Results

The project will output:

-   Basic information about the dataset.
-   Statistical measures of the data.
-   The correlation matrix, including the correlation values of GLD with other features.
-   The predicted GLD prices on the test data.
-   The R-squared error of the model.
-   A plot comparing the actual and predicted GLD prices.

The R-squared error score indicates how well the model fits the data. A higher R-squared value (closer to 1) suggests a better fit. The plot provides a visual representation of the model's prediction accuracy.
